Files contain diy exercises of mule 4 development fundamentals.


File name : Accounts mod-3 solution 
The objective of this module is to create an API specification using RAML and specify GET and POST methods.Defined URI,query parameters and headers and restrict possible values using an enumeration.

File name: Mod 4
The objective of this module is to implement a REST API that has a RAML specification.In this module APIKit is used to create implementation flows.
 Developed logic to APIkit auto-generated flows and enhanced an API and regenerated the flows using APIkit.
 
 File name : Mod 5
 The objective of this module is to deploy and secure an API implementation.In this module Mule application has been deployed to CloudHub,created simple test flows to automatically set sample required headers and parameters before calling an API endpoint and Created an API proxy for a Mule application and applied an SLA based rate limiting policy.After the application has deployed , it is configured to manage its own API proxies ,redployed and tested the implementation of the applied proxies.
 
 File name : Mod 6
 The objective of this module is to troubleshoot and refactor a Mule application by diagnosing and repairing common Mule event-related, RAML-related, and connector-related issues.
 
File name : Mod 7
The objective of this module is to track data through an application that has several flows using Flow References and providing connection boundy by replacingFlow reference with HTTP request and ensure event data is accessible in a flow before and after it crosses a connection boundary.Made HTTP requests asynchronouslyand created a configuration properties YAML file to store property placeholders in a hierarchy.

File name : Mod 8
The objective of this module is to retrieve data from several different data sources and combine them using DataWeave.

File nanme : Mod 9
The objective of this module is to control message flow using validators by validating REST and SOAP response schemas,retrived data concurrently and used filter on retrived data.

File name : Mod 10
The objective of this module is to handle errors in a Mule application by using global error handler,compare the differences by implementing On Error Propogate and On error Continue.Created custom error handles as well.

File name : Mod 11
The objective of this module is to combine multiple data sources using DataWeave.In this module,map function was used to iterate through arrays,used if-else conditions statements to change the output based on conditions.Sort and filter functions are used to modify data structures

File name : module 12
The objective of this module is to connect Mule applications and other systems together using various connectors such as JMS queus.For writing files , FTP and file connectors ware used.

File name : Module 13
The objective of this module is to create a batch processing system.Using batch filters,batch step processing is controlled,exchanged data between batch steps and variables and triggered batch processing using a scheduler.
